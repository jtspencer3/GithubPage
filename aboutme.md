# About Me

Hello, I am a 19 year old Information Technology student at the University of Missouri. I am from Oak Grove, Missouri which is a small town about 25 minutes from Kansas City. I am currently finishing up my sophomore year. I only started to code in the summer of 2019 but I have spent a lot of my life sitting behind a computer monitor. I can't believe I spent so many years on a computer with no idea how it actually worked. At first I didn't really like it because of how hard it is but I quickly started to realize how much fun I have while I code after I started to get the hang of it.
I dream of one day becoming a software developer at a pretty big company. I am not sure exactly what type of software I would like to create but I want to do something important.

In my free time I enjoy watching the English Premier League and the MLB with my favorite teams being Arsenal Football Club and the Boston Red Sox. I also love video games. During my freshman year of high school my cousin custom built me my gaming PC and I have spent mnore hours than I would like to admit on it. My favorite game of all time would have to be Skyrim with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive coming in at a very close second.
